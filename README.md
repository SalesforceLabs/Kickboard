## Optional Installation Instructions

This repository contains several files that are relevant if you want to integrate modern web development tooling to your Salesforce development processes, or to your continuous integration/continuous deployment processes.

### Code formatting

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is a code formatter used to ensure consistent formatting across your code base. To use Prettier with Visual Studio Code, install [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. The [.prettierignore](/.prettierignore) and [.prettierrc](/.prettierrc) files are provided as part of this repository to control the behavior of the Prettier formatter.

### Code linting

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a popular JavaScript linting tool used to identify stylistic errors and erroneous constructs. To use ESLint with Visual Studio Code, install [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode-lwc) from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. The [.eslintignore](/.eslintignore) file is provided as part of this repository to exclude specific files from the linting process in the context of Lightning Web Components development.

### Pre-commit hook

This repository also comes with a [package.json](./package.json) file that makes it easy to set up a pre-commit hook that enforces code formatting and linting by running Prettier and ESLint every time you `git commit` changes.

To set up the formatting and linting pre-commit hook:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) if you haven't already done so

1. Run `npm install` in your project's root folder to install the ESLint and Prettier modules (Note: Mac users should verify that Xcode command line tools are installed before running this command.)

Prettier and ESLint will now run automatically every time you commit changes. The commit will fail if linting errors are detected. You can also run the formatting and linting from the command line using the following commands (check out [package.json](./package.json) for the full list):

```
npm run lint:lwc
npm run prettier
```
